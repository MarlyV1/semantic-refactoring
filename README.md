# Semantic-Refactoring

## Description

After I was provided code for an existing site, it was then refractred to make it more accessible. By refractoring this code, it has led to an increase in web accessibility for people with disabilities who require the use of assistive technologies. The div elements within the HTML file were updated with semantic HTML elements that could then be interpretated by screen readers and other assistive devices. Furthermore, CSS selectors were consolidated in order to follow the proper semantic structure.

## Usage

The site can be utilized by using the functioning navigation bar to go to the three main sections within the page. For instance, clicking on the Search Engine Optimization button on the naviation bar will lead to the section providing more details about the topic. The same can be done for the two other buttons on the navigation bar. ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
